0,0,Sequoia National Park,media/sequoia_trees.jpg,Image Source: National Park Foundation,https://www.nationalparks.org/connect/blog/7-cant-miss-activities-sequoia-and-kings-canyon-national-parks,"Sequoia National Park in California is home to over 1,300 native plant species. One of these is the giant sequoia, the enormous trees that the park is named for. Due to climate change, these trees are threatened by higher temperatures and more intense wildfires. Along with this, Sequoia National Park is also frequently impacted by poor air quality that is unhealthy for the park’s organisms and visitors.

1,1,EPA Air Quality Monitoring,media/AQI.jpg,Image Source: Environmental Protection Agency,https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/,"Since 1980, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been monitoring air quality around the United States by using thousands of monitoring stations. Two monitoring stations are located right next to Sequoia National Park. To measure air quality, they developed the Air Quality Index (AQI). The AQI is on a scale of 0 to around 500, with the higher the value, the more polluted the air. An AQI of 100 or below is considered acceptable. Along with the overall AQI, the EPA also monitors more specific AQI values for criteria pollutants, such as ozone and PM2.5 (particulate matter). Common sources of ozone pollution include emissions from industrial facilities, exhaust from motor vehicles, and gasoline vapors. Common sources of PM2.5 pollution include construction sites, fires, unpaved roads, and smokestacks.",,,,,,,,,,
2,2,Meteostat Weather Station,,,,"Along with the EPA air quality monitoring station right next to Sequioa National Park, there is also a weather station not far away. From this station, meteorological data from Meteostat such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed is available. This information will be used to compare to the air quality data to determine what weather conditions are related the most to poor air quality in Sequoia National Park.",17,,,,,,,,,
3,3,Seasonality of AQIs,media/time_series.jpg,Image Source: Lena Miller,,"By plotting each AQI with max temperature throughout the years, seasonal and yearly trends can be determined. Both ozone and PM2.5 pollution levels have stayed fairly stable since 2006, except for an outlier for PM2.5 in September of 2021. During this time, one of the worst wildfires that Sequoia National Park has ever experienced was burning. Overall, ozone pollution tends to be much higher in summer months when temperatures are higher, but PM2.5 pollution does not have as drastic of a seasonal trend. It does tend to be somewhat higher in winter months when temperatures are lower.",,,,,,,,,,
4,4,Pollution from Bay Area and Other Sources,media/san_fran.jpg,Image Source: San Francisco Chronicle,https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Air-quality-worsens-for-parts-of-Bay-Area-15694254.php,"One reason that Sequoia National Park suffers so much from poor air quality is due to the park being downwind of several major sources of pollution. Some of these sources include major highways, agricultural areas, and even from as far away as the San Francisco Bay Area. Due to wind patterns, the pollution from these sources is blown right into the park.",,,,,,,,,geojson/NCSU_campuses.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black
5,5,KNP Complex Fire,media/wildfire.jpg,Image Source: NPR,https://www.npr.org/2022/07/23/1113158387/us-forest-service-emergency-action-sequoias-wildfire,"From September until December of 2021, one of the worst wildfires Sequoia National Park has ever seen, the KNP Complex Fire, was burning. By the time it was 100% contained, the fire burned over 88,000 acres of land. While giant sequoias are usually resistant to fire, thousands of these trees were killed due to the KNP Complex Fire. To look at how air quality is affected by wildfires such as this one, the daily sizes of the fire were taken from the National Interagency Fire Center to compare to the air quality variables.",,,,,,,,,wake_county_census_tracts.geojson,fillColor:purple;color:black
6,6,Correlation Coefficients of Air Quality and Environmental Variables,media/corrcoef.jpg,Image Source: Lena Miller,,"To compare how the air quality indexes and environmental variables are related, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated. This coefficient is a number between -1 and 1, and is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. A value close to -1 indicates a strong negative linear relationship, while closer to 1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship. Values close to zero indicate no linear relationship. Ozone was found to have a strong positive correlation with temperature, which means that when temperatures are high, ozone levels are high. High wind speeds were found to be correlated with high levels of ozone pollution, but low levels of PM2.5 pollution. This could be due to sources of ozone pollution from the Bay Area and major highways being blown into the park, while high winds blow out sources of PM2.5 pollution. Surprisingly, the size of the KNP Complex Fire was not correlated with PM2.5 levels, as the coefficient value was very close to zero. This could be because strong winds blow smoke from wildfires in the western US all the way to major cities on the east coast such as New York, but closer states such as Colorado and Utah are not as affected (Filonchyk et al. 2022)",,,,,,,,,wake_co_census_colored_AWATER.geojson,fillColor:blue;color:white
